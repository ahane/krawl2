# oshi-crawl

oshi crawler

## Setup

_Requirements_
Python >= 3.6
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
See [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) how to install poetry
Once you have `poetry` in your PATH.
Install the project by entering the `krawl` dir (where the `pyproject.toml` file is located) and typing
`poetry install`
`poetry shell`

All commands in the `bin/` directory expect the `poetry shell` to be active.

_Credentials_

All environment variables in the `.env.example` file must be defined.
You might want to use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to automatically source the `.env` file you created.

# Wikibase specifc env variables:

`KRAWLER_WB_USER="..."`

`KRAWLER_WB_PASSWORD="..."`

# Wikibase OAuth client:

`KRAWLER_WB_CONSUMER_KEY="..."`

`KRAWLER_WB_CONSUMER_SECRET="..."`

`KRAWLER_WB_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."`

`KRAWLER_WB_ACCESS_SECRET="..."`

(ask your wikibase admin if you are unsure how to get this)

# Wikibase Reconciler Prop ID

`KRAWLER_WB_RECONCILEPROPID="..."`

This is the id (ie. P123) of a wikibase property of type URL and ideally name "id".
This property has to be created in wikibase and then set here.

# Github specific env variables:

KRAWLER_GITHUB_KEY="..."

(get one [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

This can be any directory where the krawler can write its intermediary files.
KRAWLER_WORKDIR="..."

## Execute

`krawl/bin/fetch/github/gh.sh`
To fetch project from github

`krawl/bin/fetch/wikifactory/wf.sh`
To fetch projects from wikifactory

`krawl/bin/push/rdf.sh`

To convert all TOML to RDF (turtle, ttl)
`krawl/bin/push/wikibase.sh`

To push all found projects to wikibase
(note that the pusher currently always pushes every file it finds, even if it has already been pushed)

If you want to push an individual `ttl` file you can also use:
`python -m krawl.wikibase.core ./samples/okh-sample-OHLOOM_fixed.ttl`
